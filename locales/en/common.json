    "title": "The Problem & Solution",
    "description": "Modern full-stack development is 90% repetitive setup and 10% actual coding. Starting a new project is like navigating a maze of configuration files, database connection strings, and boilerplate code.",
    "solution": "FullstackAgent is a powerful orchestration platform that eliminates all setup friction. With one click, you get a complete, isolated development environment with your AI engineer already logged in and ready to receive your instructions, with built-in Next.js, PostgreSQL, and shadcn/ui."
